# LambdaExperiments
Me playing with the lambda calculus and type inference.

Coding stuff is a very effective way of learning right? In there there is quite a bunch of different small experiments within the topics of the lambda calculus and type theory.
Not sure if all of them work and i'm not even sure if all of them compile, but they certainly helped me understand stuff.
